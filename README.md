Python code implementing some of the algorithms described in my book

Drugowitsch (2008). Design and analysis of learning classifier systems: a probabilistic approach. Springer

The code was written around 2007 for old versions of Python, Numpy and Scipy. It most likely won't run on any of the newer versions, and is only provided as a reference to understand the algorithmic descriptions provided in the book.

The two main executables are `exp1.py` and `exp2.py`. All other files either provide utility functions or modules used by these executables.

The code is provided under the MIT License, with all its caveats. These include no guarantee of its correctness. So, if you decide to use this code, please ensure that it does what you intend it to do.
